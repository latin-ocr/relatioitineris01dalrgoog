The other they call the Pilaware,(¹⁷) in which
cod-fish are caught all the year round; but the
most convenient time to catch them is in the
colder months, for the warm westher interferes
with salting them. Now this great abundance of

fish arises from the following cause: the wind,
which uniformly blows from the Canarics to the

north-east, drives the water of the ocean, and, with
it, the tish· into the Gulf of Mexico; from which,
since there is no escape for it either to the castor
the south, it is driven with great force towards the
north, and carries with it large numbers of fish
along the shores of Florida, Virginia, Maryland,
and New England. These, fiying from the larger
fish, take refuge in shallow places where they are
more easily caught by the fishermcn. '
There are various notable rivers. The chief of
these they call the Attomeck, (Potomac,) a naviga·
hle river running eastward 140 miles, where there
is such a lucrative trade with the Indians, that a
certain merchant in the last year, exported beaver
skins to the value of 40,000 gold orowns, and the
profit of the traffie is estimated at thirty fold. ’
flu the plains and in the open fields there is a
great abundance of'grass3 but the country is, for
the most part, thickly wooded. There are agreat
many hickory trees, and the oahs are so straight
and tall, that beams, sixty feet long and 2} feet
