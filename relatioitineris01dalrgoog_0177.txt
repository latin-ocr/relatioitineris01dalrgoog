in the ricinity 01 the new settlements. During the iirst five or six ,
years he was j0ined' by several missionsrics from Europe3 the
names 01 Fathers Brook, Philip Fishcr, Roget Rigby erc men·
tioned. On the authority 01 a MS. document ascribed to Arch-
bishop Carroll, (the first Archbishop of the United states) it has
been stated -that Father White returned, in person, to Europe,
and brought back several missionaries to aid him in his iabors in
Maryland-the names oi Fathers Harkey and Perret (Parrot)
are recorded.

Father White acquired the langnage 01 the Indians, and pre·
pared agrammar and vocabulary, as well as a catechism. The
catechism alone is extant, haring been found by Father Wil-
iiam McSherry in the archires 01 the Society at Rome. The
iabors 01 the missionaries were also directed to the care and edifi-
cation 01 the members of their own charch amongst the colonists,
as well as to the conversion 01 the Protestants, who were very
numerous, ii not the majority 01 the settlers. Father White and
his colleagues, Fathers Oopiey and Altham, were summoned to
sit in the first Oolonial Assembiy* 01 the Provinee‚ but earnestly
desiring to be excused from taking part in the secuiar concerns
01 the colony, their request was granted. , “

Father White went to Mattaponi, Father Altham to Kent
Island, and Father Fisher remained at St. Mary’s.· In the “ Ex-
tracts from the Letters 01 the Missionaries '’ here printed, will

'White’s labors and success amongst the Indians 01 Patuxent,
Piscataway and Potopaco. His seli-denial, privatione and suffer·
ings, and the touching patience and cheerfulness, with which they
wore all endured, more our proiound respect and admiration:
Father White deserres a high place 01 honor amongst the many
heroic missionaries 01 the Society 01 J esus.

In 1644, Father White was seized by a band 01 the soldiers of
