Lord of Baltimore in Ireland by dames the First, about the ycar
1613, and thet he was ohosen by the University of Oxford to
represent them in Parliament in the year 1624. (Brit. Emp.) ἱ
But before this, just as the Puritans had already emigreted to
New England to escape the persecutione, by which they were har·
rassed, so he, urged by the same motive, and being presented by
the King with very large estates in the island of Newfoundland,
had, in the year 1611, sent thither some catholic colonists, who
were commanded by Edward Wynne.

About the year 1615, putting too much saith in Edward’s glowing
account of the country, he determined to visit his calculata, and
carried thither his wife and children. He called the settlement
Avalon, (noar the promontory of Ferryland, between the Bay of
Bulla on the east, and cape st, Mary’s on the south) probably,
says a geographical writer, (British Empire) from his reverende
for st. J oseph of Arimathea, who is said to have built the first
church for the Britons, whom he had converted, in Avalon, a place
which they now call Glastonbury, in Somersetshire. In the mean·
time, King J ames died in the year loat; and George, weary of
this wild region, which did not prore aa fertile as represented by
Edward, as he had heard that Virginia was a lar richer country,
determined to exploro it, inthe year 1628. (Burman, from Burk's

hist. Virg.)
