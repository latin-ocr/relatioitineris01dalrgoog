mentions, in the same place, that Georgo met with a harsh re-
ception, not indeed from the governor of Virginis, (Sir John
Harvey, who was the first governor appointed by the King, and
by whom 111 company oi merchants, which before rnled the
whole country, was broken np; and thus caure more directly
under the control and management oi the King,) bnt from the
Assembly of tha Province.

'Phis body, as Georgo wasa 01111111, prohibited him from acquir·
-ing property in Virginis, and forbade him to settle there, unless he
would swear to recognize the spiritual supremacy of the King of
England, and unless his Catholic followers would bind themselves
-by 111 sama oath. Georgo refused, and turned his attention to-
wards exploring the northern shore of 111 Potomac river and the
neighboriug regions, to see whether he could not, by good fortune,
find some pleasant and fertile landa, to which he could convc-
niently lead his colonists, and establish thare a settlcrnent for
Catholics, where they would 11 undistnrbed.

For, although the tracts of land, which were afterwards known ’
by 111 name of Maryland, werc formerly assigned to Virginis by
J ames the First, yet the company of merchants, to whom he had
granted those landS, as 1 part of Virginis, having become extinct,
they had again, at length, fallen into tha hands of the King, who
could at that time, bestow them upon any one, according to his
own pleasure.

Itis not indeed certain, as Bozman says, from any testimony
of men, or historical recorda, that George, after he 1111 Virginis, ¹

turned his course to the north and sailed into the Uhesapeake Bay, k

to see tha country, or its inhabitants. Yet, a man 11 111 wisdom,
and cherishing the design which he did, ought not to have omitted
this investigatiou. But, however that may be, he had already
returned to England in the year 1631, and requested from charles
the First, that 111 district, which extends northwards from the
Potomac, should 11 granted to him aud his heirs.
