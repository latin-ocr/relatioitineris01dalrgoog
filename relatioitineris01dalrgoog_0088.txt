voyage, both such as intend to‘try their fortunes
with him, and others also. Indeed, after atten-
tively considering the whole matter, and taking
the advice of men, distinguished for their experi-
ence and wisdom, he has now weighed, with great
care, all the advantages, as well as disadvantages,
which have hitherto advanced or hindered other
eolonies; and found nothing which does not tend
strongly to confirm him in his design, and promise
him the most prosperous success. For, both the
writings which his Most N oble Fatherlll has left
behind him-an eye-witnessed reliable and worthy
of all eredit—and the constant reports of those
men who come to us every day from that country,
or places not far from it; and besides, the very
faithful accountffl) written and published by Oap·
tain Smith, who first discovered the country-
what he says of the fertility and excellence of its
soil is truly wonderful and almost incredible—add
to these also the unanimous agreement and testi·
mony of numbers of men, living herc (in London)
who formerly came from those countries, and
intend to return there3 and who, with one voice,

verify and confirm what Smith has written.
