oned on a charge of violating the law conceming “Missionaryq

Popish Priests,’' and, after great suffering and severity, he was ·

released, on asentence oi banishment srom the country. He peti-
tioued his superiore for permission to return to his beloved floclr,
aud painful labours, in the Golony, but his age and many iufirmi-
ties prevented his request from being granted. Alter a few
months of exile, he again returned to England, under au assumed
name. The accounts of him from this time, are very vaguc and

uncertain. It has, however, been recorded that the holy man Ι
foresaw, aud named, the day and hour of his death, viz: the Fecit
of ³St. John the Evangelia, 27 Dec. 1656. On that day, though
uot more ill than usual, he insisted upon receiving the last Sac- .
ramento of the Church, and about sunset hreathed his last, in
London, in the vsth year of his age. Father Southwell, in his

, “Bibliotheo Scriptorum, S. J.,'' gives the following glowing eulo-

gium of thismost picus aud worthy Apostle ol Marylaud:

“Vir fuit non mimis sanctitate vitre, quam doctriua conspicuus
magnii eluxit abstinentia, sclopano et aqud saepe victitans, nec
his nisi sub vesperam se reficiebat. ¹[Pam profunda hnmilitate
fuit, ut abjiciendi sese occasiones ultro quaerebat. Incommode·
rum corporis adeo patiens, ut quamvis lougt et permolestd labora·
ret infirmitate, nunquam tamen auditus sit queri, sed quoad
licebat, pro sano se gerebat, hhc una in re simulator egregius
'Denique quaecumque agebat, sanctimoniam quamdam spirare
videbantur, utnon defuerint viri gravae, qui asseruerint, si quon·
quam vidissent in hac vite sanctum, eum procul dubio luisse Pa·
trem Andream Vitum.’' κ
