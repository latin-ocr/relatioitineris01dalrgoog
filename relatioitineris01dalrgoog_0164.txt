. . . The narrowest. . . . At the present time also, as is seen to·
day, this orossing is shorter than any other in the whole course
of the river. Itis easy, then, to infer from this, that the fleet
sailed to the island in question, but not to St. George's Island or
elsewhere3 forthere is no other narrower orossing plaoeauywhere
on the river.

In addition to this, the island was nine leugues (or twenty·
seven miles) from the mouth of the river, which is now oalled st.
Mary’s, as will appear in this letter, page 36. Now, indeed, this
is the exact distance between Herous' Isload and the mouth of
St. Mary's River or buy, which the pilgrims then called St.
George’s. Moreover, St. George’s Island, whieh goes by tlie
same name today, is situated just at the mouth of the river, and
from the western extremity of this island, by making a cirouit of -
only three miles, you ean enter the main stream ol the river.
