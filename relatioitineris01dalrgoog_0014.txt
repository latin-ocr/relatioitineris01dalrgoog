PREFACE.

Abour the year 1832, the Rev. William McSherry, S. J., discovered
in the archives of the “Domus Professa” of the Society iu Rome, the
originale of the MSS. which are named on the title page. He carefully
copied these MSS. and placed the copies in the Library of Georgetown
Collega, D. 0, of which institution (being at the same time Provincial
of the Society in Maryland,) he afterwards became the honored Presi-
dent. ln the year 13344, through the kind agency of the Rev. Charles J.
White, D. D, the Faculty of Georgetown Collega presented to the Mary-
land Historieal Society, ahandsome copy of Fathar McSherry’s tran-
scripts of the Roman MSS„ A very excellent translation was made from
this copy in the year 1847, by Nathan 0. Brooks, L. L. D., a member of
the Maryland Historical Society. Several copies of the translation were
printed, and subsequently, it was published in “Peter Foree’s collection
of Historical Tracts,'’ vol. iv, No. 12.

The translation of Dr. Broolrs having become exceedingly rare, the
Maryland Historieal Society resolved to print, not only, anew transla-

was then discovered that the MSS. had unaccountably disappeared from
the archives of the Society; and all efforts to recover the volume, or even
to trace it, were unavailing. Application was therefore made to the
Faculty of Georgetown Collega for permission to make a second copy
from the MS. in their Library. After much delay in searching for it,
it was ascertained that Father McSherry’s MS. was no longer in the
Library of Georgetown college, but in that of Loyola Collega, in Balti-
more. Through the kind offices of Mr. John Murphy, the Faculty of
Loyola College very promptly loaned to the Maryland Historieal Society
the MS. in their Library This was carefully copied, and afterwards
collated with much pains; and it is now printed verbatim, literatius, et
punctuatim. In several respecta, (but few of them however of any im-
portance,) it differs, in orthography, punctuation, use of capital letters,
de, from the copy from which was made the former copy of the Maryland
Historical Society, and which was translated by Doctor Brooks. The
. text moreover ends very abruptly on page 61 of this publication ς where-
as, in the former copy, it included the entire Latin original of the last
