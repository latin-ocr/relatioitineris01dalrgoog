Sailing hence to the fortunate isles, we were
received in a large Bay, where there is nothing
to be feared excepting the calms, but since these
last fifteen days and sometimes three weeks, the
supplies of the navigatore give out. But this
rarely happens, scarcely once or twice in a
century( Nevertheless very frequent delays are
unavoidable, on account of the wind’s failing,
which, when it blows, is always one and the
same, being favorable to this voyage of oure.

When we arrived at this bay, wo had sailed
“ three thousand Italian miles under full sail,

passrng over a milk-white sea, without being de-

, layed at all by calms, except occasionally, for a
’ single hour, about mid-day.

·I cannot easily discover the cause of sueha
constant wind, unless, perehance, one should say
it ariscs from the sun’s being so near, as it
posses between the tropics, and from the fact
that it draws from the sea, by the power of its
heat, two kinds of vapor, the one dry from the
saltness of the sea, the other rnoist by reason of
the water: the wind proceeds from the former,
and from the latter are produced the rains3 and
so the sun drawing both towards itself, is the
cause of their always keeping the same oblique
course with the sun, and constantly following it.
And thia,t00, may have been the reason, why wo
met with great heat and an abundance of rain,
