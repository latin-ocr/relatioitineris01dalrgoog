. . . Two harbors . . Ι. 000 01 these. . . within these 200 years,
since 1634, the force of the current has washed away certain por·
tions of the banhs of the river. This is evident, ist, fromnoto F, s
page 104 ; 1011οο0 anexamination of the place called Fort Polnt,
on an estate near 80101 Inigoes, where Leonard Calvert had built
01011, which was swallowed up, together with ten or twclve 01 1110
very cannon he had placed there. But Father Joseph Carbery
drew out seven, which vvere sunk in the sand and covered by the
advancing tide, more than ahundred fathoms (or 200 yavds) from
1110 shore, and which were casier 10 reach, though one or two lay
at about the depth 01 20 1001. 1110 only 00001000 the water
swallowed up so many fathoms 01 solid land, why could 001 the
same thing have happened around Herons’ Islund at 8101000010 ?
Why not avound Pioey Poiol, and along the ohannel between the
present island 01 St. George and the whole shore, clear to Cherry
Polot-the shore being extended by deposita of earth brought down
from other places? Perhaps at this time the mouth of the Bay,
which the writer call 81. 11000000, could be'entered directly srom
Pincy Point, and the above mentioned channel‚ now impassable for
large ships, at that time ufforded thern apassage. The fact that the
smaller Bay—the first one to the 101101 Piney Point-still bears
11100000 01 St. Georgo, is in favor 01 11110 00000οἰ1100, and also
the channel which 10 mentioned above.

From this there is an entrance to the larger Bay, which the

travellers also called 81. George's, but which has now changed 110
name, being called 81. 1110000, 00 well astho inncr bay oi St.
¹ Mary’s towards the north and beyond the channel 01 St. Ignatius.
Moreover‚ what 11 1110 present island 01 St. Georgo was small at
that time, having grown hy deposita of mud and saud? For un

this island are seen to-day no doubtful proofs that the land was
formerly sunk [below the water?]; that it has recently been
thrown up and is not yet completely formed. .
