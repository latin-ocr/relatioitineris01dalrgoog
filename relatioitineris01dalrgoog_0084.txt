The soil is <laih and not hard, to the depth of a

foot, and overlays a rich, red clay. There are
lofty trees everywhere, except where the land has
been cultivated by a few persons. N umerous
springs furnish a supply of water. No animale
are seen except deer, beavers and squirrels‚ which

is not without such things, as contribute to the
prosperity or pleasure of those, who inhabit it.
