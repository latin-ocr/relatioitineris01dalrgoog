thirty-nine pagos of the translation. All efforts to procure the text of
these thirty-nine pages have proved fruitless, the Librarians of George-
town and Loyola Collegae having in vain searched for Father McSher-

thirty-nine peges, (which are printed from Force’s Tracta) the translation
here given, is original. lt was made by a very competent young scholar,
who has not only correctly rendered the originale, but very successfully
reproduced the homely and simple style in which they are written.

All the notes and commenta of the MSS, as they are found on the
margin, are printed after the “Extrema” In the few notes added by
the Editor, will be notlccd any important variatione between the trans-
lation of Dr. Brooks and the text now first published, as well as afew
things, which seemed of interest to elucidata the narrative. It may bc
proper to add thata Latin text of the “Relatio '’ and the “Delemna'’
as it seems to have been written in the copy translated by Dr. Brooks,
was printed in 1872, in the “Woodstock Letters,'' with a revision of
the translation of Dr. Brooks, for private circulation anrongst the mem·
bera of the S. J.

The value of this publication, will of course, be variously estimated by
the persons, into whose hands it may corne: the Maryland Historioal

Society, however, hopes it has done what will provelof interest, if not of

value, ιο all who are studente of the early history of Maryland.

The Editor takes this occasion to return his thanlrs to the Bresidents
and Faculties of Georgetown and Loyola Collegae, for their ready assist-
ance in the loan of MSS, and their efforts to find the originale of Father
MeSherry-to William Lucas and J ohn Murphy, Esqrs., for their kind
loun of valuuble and rare publicatione, as the sources of the brief memoir
of Futhcr White, in the Appendix, and especially ιο the Rev. John S.
Sumner, S. J, his ancient college mate and friend, for his constant
interest and valuable suggestions, aethe peges were passing through the

prese. E. A. D.
