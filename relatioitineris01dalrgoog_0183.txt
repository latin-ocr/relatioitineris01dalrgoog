The κ110010001100000100 to have been prepared 1011110 Gene-
ral of the Society of lesus, or whosoever had the authority to
select, and send out missionaries, for the purpose of giving him
full knowledge of the country, in which Lord Baltimore was about
to establish his Oolony. A perusal of it will show, in how many
particulars the author of it was in error, und how he had been
misled by the accounts of fortune-secking travellers in the new
world. lt is sad to contrusi the glowing accounts of Maryland
in the “Declamatio'’ aud the painful experienoe of the missionu-
ries-the author himself, perhaps, among them-as set out in the
extracta from their letters.

As the writer of the “delectationes” intimatos, on p. 114, the text
01 Father McSherry⁷s transcript was of doubtful correctness, and
hence his parenthetical explanatione. But ewen the Annotator is
clearly in error, in several places, in the attempted elucidation 01
Fr. McSherry’s text. The following are to be noted 00 1110 most
important variatione between the text of the H. S. end that 01
the “ Woodstock Letters.’'
