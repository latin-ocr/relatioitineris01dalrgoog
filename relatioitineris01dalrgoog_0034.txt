tar, and the Madeiras, with favorable winds, which
were no longer variahle but blew steadily
towards the South and the south-west, the
direction in which we were sailing3 three ships
carne in sight, one of which was larger than
ours; moreover they appeared to be about three
leagues (nine miles) off, towards the west, and
to be trying to corne up with us; now and then,
also, they would send messengers to and fro and
communicate with each other. As we suspected
that they were Turhish pirates, we made all the
necessary preparatione ior fighting. And there
were some among our rnen, who inconsiderately
urged the captain to approach and attach them
without provocation. But since he had aMaster,
to whorn he had to render an account, he doubted
whether he could give a plausible reason for
fighting, and indeed I think the contest would
have been an ardnous one, though, perhaps they
ieared us as much as we did thern3 and they
were, as I conjecture, merchants who were on
their way to the Fortunate Islands, not far

distant, and either could not overtahe us, or
did not wish tc. ’
