his pipe with tohaccO, after they had been ground
to powdcr, often boasting that he had eaten up
his “Ave Marias;'' for so he called the beads,
by telling of which the salutation of the angel is
recited. ,But the divine vongeance did not let the
wicked crime go long unpunished3 for scarcely a
year having passed, on the returning vigil of
the day, on which he had abandoned his purpose
of embraoing the catholic faith, a more sacrile-
gious playfulness possessed him, as was noticed
by his companions. Therefore, in the afterno'on,
when he had betaken himself to the river for the
purpose of swimming, scarcely had he touched the
water when a huge fish having suddenly seized the
wiched man, before he could retreat to the bank,
tore away, at a bite,a large portion of his thigh,
by the pain of which most merited lac'eration, ,
the unhappy wretoh was hurried away from the
living-the divine justice bringing it about, that
he, who a little while before boasted that he had
caten up his “Ave Maria beads,'’ should see his
own fiesh devoured, even while he was yet living.
