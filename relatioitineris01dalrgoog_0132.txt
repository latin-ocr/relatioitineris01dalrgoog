they meet a toacher clearly explaining these
things, they show themselves very attentive as
well as docile; and by and by are seriously turned
to think of their souls; so as to be ready to ob-
tain those things, which, they perceiva conduce
to the salvation of the same. They are readily
swayed by reason, nor do they withhold their
assent obstinately from the truth set forth ina
credible manner. This natural disposition of the
tribe, aided by the seasonable assistance of divino
graec, gives us hope oi the most desirable harvest
bersahee, and animatas us to continue our lahors
in this vineyard with the greatest exertion. And
the same ought to be an incitament to all'those
who in future, b'y the will of God, may come
hitherto us for supply or assistance. Ἰ

To tha' hope of the Indian harvest, are to be
added also no mean fruits reaped from the colony
and its inhabitants, to whom, on the principal
festival days of the year, sermons are preacbed,
and the catechetieal expositions given on the
Lord’s day. Not only catholics come in crowds‚
but also very many heretics-not without the
reward of our labors; for this year, twelvo in

all, wearied of former errors, have returned to ·

favor with God and the church. Our people
ceas'c not daily to engage in their divine employ-
ment, and to dispenso the sacramenta to those
that come, as often as circumstances demand.
