The watchtul care of Divine Providence con·
soled us for the bitter harshness of men. For wo
understood that a Spanish fieet was stationed off
the island ot Bonavista, to keep all foreigners
t‘rom engaging in the salt trade. If, kecping to
our appointed route, we had gone on thither, we
should have fallen into the net, and become the
prey of our enemies. In the meantime, we were
delivered from a greater danger at Barbadoes:
the servantsffl’ throughout the whole island had
conspired to kill their masters, then, indeed,
aiter having gained their liberty, it was their
intention to possess themselves of the first ship
which should· touch there, and venture to sea.
The conspiracy was disclosed by one who was
deterred by the atrocious cruelty of the enter·
prise3 and the punishment of one of the leaders
was sufficient for¹ the security of the island and
our own safety. For our ship, as being the first
to touch there, had been marked for their prey;
and on the very day we lauded, we found eight
hundred men in arms to oppose this wicked
design, which had just transpired.

The Island of, Barbadoes is 30 miles in length
and 16 in breadth3 it is 13 degrees from the equa-
tor, and the climate is so war‘m, that the inhab-
itants in the winter months wear linen clothes and
bathe frequently. It was harvest time when we
arrived. It would be impossible to live there,
